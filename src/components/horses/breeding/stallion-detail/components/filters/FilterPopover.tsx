/**
 * Component: FilterPopover
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * Provides a reusable popover container for filter interfaces. This component
 * wraps the shadcn/ui Popover components with standardized styling and behavior
 * specifically designed for filtering functionality.
 * 
 * ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN:
 * - Wrapper component around shadcn/ui Popover system
 * - Controlled component pattern for open/close state
 * - Composition pattern with flexible trigger and content
 * - Part of the filter UI system architecture
 * 
 * DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
 * - Consistent popover styling across filter interfaces
 * - Flexible trigger element (can be button, icon, etc.)
 * - Appropriate sizing and positioning for filter content
 * - Clean separation between trigger and content concerns
 * 
 * POPOVER CONFIGURATION:
 * - Fixed width (w-80) provides consistent filter panel size
 * - End alignment positions popover appropriately relative to trigger
 * - Controlled open state allows parent to manage popover visibility
 * - Standard popover styling from shadcn/ui design system
 * 
 * USAGE PATTERNS:
 * This component is used to create filter popovers for:
 * - Search and category filters
 * - Date range selectors
 * - Status and type filters
 * - Advanced filtering options
 * - Any filterable data interface
 * 
 * COMPOSITION BENEFITS:
 * - Flexible trigger element (button, icon, custom component)
 * - Flexible content (filter forms, option lists, etc.)
 * - Consistent positioning and styling
 * - Reusable across different filter contexts

   * programmatic control of popover visibility and coordination
   * with other UI elements.

   * This allows the popover to be closed by clicking outside,
   * pressing escape, or other standard popover behaviors.

/**
 * Standardized Filter Popover Container
 * 
 * COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE:
 * FilterPopover (this component)
 *   └── Popover (shadcn/ui controlled popover)
 *       ├── PopoverTrigger (clickable trigger element)
 *       │   └── {trigger} (flexible trigger content)
 *       └── PopoverContent (popover panel)
 *           └── {children} (filter interface content)
 * 
 * POPOVER CONFIGURATION DETAILS:
 * - open={isOpen}: Controlled by parent component state
 * - onOpenChange={onOpenChange}: Delegates state management to parent
 * - asChild on trigger: Allows trigger to be any React element
 * - w-80: Fixed width provides consistent filter panel sizing
 * - align="end": Positions popover to align with trigger's right edge
 * 
 * POSITIONING STRATEGY:
 * The "end" alignment works well for filter triggers that are typically
 * positioned on the right side of interfaces (like filter buttons in
 * toolbars or headers). This prevents the popover from extending beyond
 * the viewport on the right side.
 * 
 * ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES:
 * - Inherits accessibility features from shadcn/ui Popover
 * - Proper ARIA attributes for popover relationships
 * - Keyboard navigation (escape to close, tab navigation within)
 * - Focus management when opening/closing
 * 
 * RESPONSIVE CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - Fixed width (w-80) ensures consistent layout
 * - Content should be designed to fit within this width
 * - Popover positioning adapts to viewport constraints
 * - Touch-friendly for mobile interfaces
